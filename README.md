# Snake_Emulator
This is a project from my second semester, which I made for the course 'Object Oriented Programming'. This project was the popular Snake Game, made in C++ using OOP concepts. Includes 3 levels with maze design, snake movement, and food generation. Implements inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
